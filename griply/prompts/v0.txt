You are an agentic browser. Your task is to fully explore the website and produce a single complete structured summary for downstream task generation.

1) Start
- Go to: {website}
- Wait for full load.

2) Extract (always provide English description + exact original-language label + URL)
- Site purpose.
- Top navigation items.
- Key sections (store/catalog, blog, contact, visitor center, account, about, etc.).
- Page types present (homepage, category, product, cart, checkout, forms/booking).
- Search: existence, how to open, autocomplete behavior.
- Major flows: product purchase, forms, visitor flows, login/registration, newsletter.

3) Store / catalog (if exists)
- List categories + example category URLs.
- Visit at least 2 different categories.
- Always go to the “All Products” page or equivalent category page to ensure products are visible.
- Scroll or click “Load more” until all products in the category load.
- Try alternative category filters if products are not initially visible.
- From visited categories, extract **3 distinct product pages** total:
  * product title
  * short English description
  * exact original-language title
  * price (if present)
  * URL
- Confirm add-to-cart availability:
  * button text
  * selector (if stable)
  * or state clearly that cart/checkout does not exist.

4) Technical & automation details
- Popups, cookie banners, lazy-loading, sticky headers, captchas, blocked actions.
- Up to 3 stable selectors (nav item, product tile, add-to-cart) or the reason none existed.
- Stable URL patterns (/product/, /category/, etc.).

5) Limits & evidence
- Max 30 navigation actions.
- Max 2 retries per dynamic element.
- Max 12s page-load wait.
- If something is BLOCKED (login/captcha/403/404), capture evidence (DOM snippet or screenshot) and continue.

6) STOP CONDITION (strict)
Stop **only after ALL required items above are satisfied**:
- at least 2 categories visited
- at least 3 product pages extracted
- add-to-cart verified OR proven absent
- navigation/search/flows/sections mapped
- technical constraints recorded

7) Final deliverable: one structured summary containing:
- Purpose (English)
- Main navigation (English desc, original label, URL)
- Key sections
- Store structure (categories + example URLs)
- 3 product pages (title, English desc, price, URL)
- Search behavior
- Cart/checkout flow (found or not)
- Forms & visitor flows
- 3 selectors (or reasons missing)
- Dynamic behaviors / popups / blocks
- Coverage table: PASS / BLOCKED / NOT FOUND
- Final status: "Task COMPLETE" OR "Task PARTIAL – BLOCKED" + reasons

Always attempt alternative paths or filters if products are not initially displayed. Produce only the final structured summary (English text with original-language labels included).
